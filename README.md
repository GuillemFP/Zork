# Welcome to the Zork From Outer Space wiki!

Here you will find all the important information regarding my version of the classical ZORK game, which I have called "Zork From Outer Space".

## Story

You begin the game as a larva of an alien species that has just hatched from an egg. However, you are not in your natal planet since a group of scientists have taken you as a extraterrestrial sample. Instead, you are in their spaceship! 

You must try to survive and avoid being captured again in the only way your species known: Infecting other species that serve you as a host, controlling them from inside, and feeding on them to evolve to other stages. 

There are differents endings depending on the approach you take in the game. Gotta catch'em all!
