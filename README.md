## Story

You begin the game as a larva of an alien species that has just hatched from an egg. However, you are not in your natal planet since a group of scientists have taken you as a extraterrestrial sample. Instead, you are in their spaceship! 

You must try to survive and avoid being captured again in the only way your species known: Infecting other species that serve you as a host, controlling them from inside, and feeding on them to evolve to other stages. 

There are differents endings depending on the approach you take in the game. Gotta catch'em all!

## How to finish the game (Spoilers!):

In both endings you will need to reach at least _ARACHNID_ form, since you need to open normal doors.
The best way to accomplish that is to feed on the engineer in the _enginge_ room, and on the medic in the _medbay_ or the scientist in the _kitchen_.
Once you are in _ARACHNID_ form you will be able to move to any room of the spaceship.

Try not to get stuck! If you kill all the characters in the _engine_ room and _medbay_ and you doesn't have enough points to evolve, you will became trapped!'

In order to get the _Fugitive_ ending, you need the code that opens the _hatch_ in the _hangar_.
Such code is in the _armory_, that is closed. The _guard_ in the _hangar_ has the key.
But he also holds the best weapon in the game, the _rifle_ that can kill your _ARACHNID_ form in only one shot.

One option is to kill him in one shot (using the carabine). In order to do that, you need to enter the _bridge_ (see below at _survivor_ ending).
The other option is to achieve _ARACHNID_ form, infect a host and take the knife from the backpack in the medbay.
You will attack the guard using the knife, and it will kill your host in the counterattack. This will expose you _ARACHNID_ form.
Attack it again, now with your claws, and you will finish him.

Now you need to search for another host (or evolve if you have enough points). The soldier in the _medbay_ is your best choice.
Get the soldier, get the key from the dead guard, open the door to the _armory_, get the code from the briefcase.
Get back to the _hangar_, open the hatch and it's done!'

In order to get the _Survivor_ ending, you must kill all human living creatures of the ship.
You don't need to kill the rat, but in order to reach this ending you will need to.

Since you can only acces the _bridge_ from the _vent_ in the _dorms_, you need to infect the rat in the _dorms_ go to the bridge and kill it by feeding.
You will then need to infect the captain or the boatswain, your choice! Kill the other guy, open the door and feed on your host.
You don't need to reach your _BIPED_ form in order to win, but in order to take out the guard in the _hangar_ you will need a host and the _carabine_ from the boatswain,
or you can also use the same strategy as explained in the _Fugitive_ ending above.

This way, you will enter the hangar, attack at the guard with the weapon, injuring him. His counterattack will probably kill your host.
Attack him again and you will take you out. The other guys pose no problem at all.
